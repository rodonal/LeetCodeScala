  In general, all 6 fold functions apply a binary operator to each element of a collection. The result of each step is passed on to the next step (as input to one of the binary operator's two arguments). This way we can cumulate a result.

    reduceLeft and reduceRight cumulate a single result.

    foldLeft and foldRight cumulate a single result using a start value.

    scanLeft and scanRight cumulate a collection of intermediate cumulative results using a start value.
